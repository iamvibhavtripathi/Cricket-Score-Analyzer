# Cricket-Score-Analyzer

# This is a mini project based on Object Oriented Programming paradigm technique in C++.

	ABSTRACT:
	   •SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE REQUIREMENT:
        -DEV-C++ editor & compiler, 
        -IDE for CPP program
        -2 GB ram, i5 Core
      •	PLATFORM USED: C++ 
      
 INTRODUCTION:
	       I have created a cricket scorecard analyzer program which simulates/analyzes a cricket match and then displays the output on the desired screen.
          Various OOP techniques and Data structures taken into consideration are:
             -Abstraction
             -Inheritance
             -Encapsulation
             -Polymorphism
             -File Handling
             -Function Overloading
 ALGORITHM:
	  -Step 1: Start
		-Step 2: Take the input (difficulty of cricket match)
		-Step 3: Take the second input (no of overs of match)
		-Step 4: Display the scorecard accordingly
 FUTURE SCOPE:-
 
		In future I can apply Graphical user interface to this algorithm and  then I can create a user-friendly cricket game which plays automatically (can modify for manual play as well).
		I can then apply Artificial Intelligence to it to acquire real time location scenario to adjust according to the surrounding and generate the score according to the recent trend.
